# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this study is to provide an analysis on the total weekly fares for each city type - urban, rural and suburban. The analysis will indicate the total number of rides, total driver count, and total fares by each city type, average fares per ride by each city type, and average fres per driver by each city type. In addition,  the fluctuation of fares by city time from January to April is analyzed.
  
## Results
Urban cities have the highest overall rides, drivers count and largest overall fares. However, the average fare per ride and per driver are the lowest among all three city type. On the other hand, rural cities, despite having the lowest total rides, drivers count and total fares, have the highest average fare per ride and per driver. All matrixes for suburban cities are in the middle. 
  
## Summary
1.We can conlcude from the analysis that urban cities has the highest volume of rides but the lowest average fares per ride and per driver. Conclusively, Pyber can increase its profit by raising fares in urban cities. 

2.Rural cities have the lowest total volume but highest average fare, therefore, increasing the voule in rural cities may help to increase the overall profitability of the company.

3.The graph below indicates that, on average, the total fare in Jan in 2019 is the lowest among the first quarter. Some measures can be implemented to help boost the total fares earned in January. There is also a drop in total fares in March for all three cities types. Further investigation is necessary to indicate the reason for such a drop.
